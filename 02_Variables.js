//veriable is like a container in JavaScript.
//we can change the type of veriable on run time. thats why JS is dynamic type language.

//we can change like this
let num = 67; //a contain 67
console.log(num); // output 67
num = "khazir";
console.log(num); //output khizar

//variable name cannot start with number
// let 1name = "khizar"  this is not allowed

// not to use JS reserved words
//eg let var =7;  this is not allowed

//JS is case sensitive
let name = "khizar";
let Name = "riaz";  //both veriables are ok
console.log(name); //reminder name is deprecated
console.log(Name);

//difference in var let and const
//var use before ES6 so try to avoid it
//var is globally scope
var a = 12;
var b = "khizarriaz"
var c = null;
var d = undefined;
 

//const use to define constant veriable
//let use for the declaration of blocked scope veriable
